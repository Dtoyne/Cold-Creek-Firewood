# Cold-Creek-Firewood

A website I created for a Toronto based firewood delivery service.

I designed this website in October, 2016. I chose to add it to my Github to demonstrate my approach to design.

Prior to being able to program an application myself, I leveraged Wix to get the site up and running in the span of a few evenings. It is a fully responsive site.

While this business is real, both the firewood delivery service and the maintenance of this site remain a side-project.

I hope you enjoy the visual experience!
